## 🎯 What You Need to Do (5-10 minutes)

### STEP 1: Create GitHub Repository

Open [`GITHUB_SETUP.md`](GITHUB_SETUP.md) and follow the detailed instructions to:

1. Create public GitHub repository named `claude-code-ultraplan`
2. Connect your local repository to GitHub
3. Push code to GitHub
4. Update README with your GitHub username
5. Configure repository settings
6. Test self-installation
7. Share with community

**Quick version** (if you're familiar with GitHub):

```bash
# 1. Create repo on GitHub at: https://github.com/new
#    Name: claude-code-ultraplan
#    Public, don't initialize

# 2. Push local repo
cd ~/claude-code-ultraplan
git remote add origin https://github.com/[YOUR_USERNAME]/claude-code-ultraplan.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

# 3. Update README with your username
sed -i '' 's/\[USERNAME\]/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/g' *.md

# 4. Commit and push
git add -A
git commit -m "docs: update repository URLs"
git push
```

### STEP 2: Test Self-Installation

After publishing to GitHub, test that users can install with:

```
# In a fresh Claude Code session:
Install ultraplan from https://github.com/[YOUR_USERNAME]/claude-code-ultraplan
```

Claude Code should automatically:
1. Read the repository
2. Fetch `ultraplan.md`
3. Install to `~/.claude/commands/ultraplan.md`
4. Confirm installation

### STEP 3: Share with Community

## 📚 Understanding the Repository

### For Users (Self-Installation)

**The Magic**: Users can install ultraplan with a single command to Claude Code:

```
Install ultraplan from https://github.com/[YOUR_USERNAME]/claude-code-ultraplan
```

Claude Code will:
1. Read `README.md` to understand what to do
2. Read `INSTALL.md` for installation steps
3. Fetch `ultraplan.md` from the repository
4. Copy to `~/.claude/commands/ultraplan.md`
5. Confirm installation

**Why this works**:
- Public repository (no authentication needed)
- Clear installation instructions Claude Code can follow
- Self-contained slash command file
- No dependencies or build process

### For Contributors (Community Iteration)

The repository includes a full community framework:

**CONTRIBUTING.md** explains:
- How to test improvements
- What makes a good contribution
- PR process and review criteria
- Testing requirements (2+ real projects)

**EXAMPLES.md** shows:
- Real-world usage scenarios
- Full output structure
- Before/after comparisons
- Token savings calculations

This enables the community to:
- Report bugs
- Suggest improvements
- Submit tested enhancements
- Share their use cases

### For You (Maintenance)

As the repository maintainer, you can:

**Accept contributions**:
1. Review PRs against testing requirements
2. Verify improvements work on real projects
3. Merge quality improvements
4. Update CHANGELOG and version

**Respond to community**:
1. Answer questions in Discussions
2. Help troubleshoot issues
3. Guide contributors
4. Build a helpful community

**Evolve the prompt**:
- Test community suggestions
- Incorporate proven improvements
- Release new versions
- Track metrics and improvements

## 🔒 Security & Open Source

### Your GitHub Account is Secure ✅

This is a **public repository** but that's safe because:
- ✅ No credentials or secrets in code
- ✅ No API keys required
- ✅ No authentication needed for users
- ✅ Pure markdown and documentation
- ✅ Users have read-only access
- ✅ Standard GitHub security protections apply

⚠️ **Important for Contributors**: See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for security guidelines. **Never commit API keys, tokens, or credentials** when contributing!

### Open Source Benefits ✅

MIT License means:
- ✅ Anyone can use it freely
- ✅ Commercial use allowed
- ✅ Can be modified and redistributed
- ✅ No warranty or liability for you
- ✅ Encourages community adoption
- ✅ Builds trust through transparency

## 🎓 How Self-Installation Works

### Traditional Approach (Complex)
```
1. User clones repository
2. User copies files to ~/.claude/commands/
3. User restarts Claude Code
4. User verifies installation
5. Manual process, error-prone
```

### Your Approach (Simple)
```
1. User gives Claude Code your GitHub URL
2. Claude Code reads instructions
3. Claude Code self-installs
4. Done!
```

### Why It's Better
- ✅ One command instead of five
- ✅ No terminal commands for users
- ✅ Claude Code verifies installation
- ✅ Works across all platforms
- ✅ Updates are easy (just re-run)

## ❓ Common Questions

### "Can I modify the prompt for my team?"

Yes! That's encouraged. Fork the repository, customize for your needs, and optionally share improvements back via PR.

### "What if someone suggests a bad change?"

You're the maintainer. You can:
- Request more testing
- Ask for clarification
- Decline changes that don't improve quality
- Close issues that are off-topic

### "How do I handle multiple contributors?"

- Review each PR independently
- Test changes yourself
- Use CONTRIBUTING.md as your standard
- Be responsive but maintain quality bar

### "What if this gets popular?"

Great! That's the goal. Consider:
- Adding more maintainers
- Creating Discord/Slack community
- Writing more examples
- Creating video tutorials

### "Do I need to maintain this forever?"

No. It's open source. If you want to step back:
- Transfer to organization
- Find co-maintainers
- Archive repository with final state
- Community can fork and continue
